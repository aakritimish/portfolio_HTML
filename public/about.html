<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr />
<h2>Hello, I'm Aakriti, Aspiring Software Engineer!</h2>
<p>
  I'm a passionate and driven college student taking my first steps into the
  exhilarating world of software engineering. With a hunger for learning and a
  determination to make a mark in the tech industry, I'm excited to share my
  story as I embark on this exciting journey.
</p>
<h3>From Enthusiast to Explorer:</h3>
<p>
  My fascination with technology ignited at a young age when I discovered the
  magic of computers. Today, I'm enrolled at National Institute of Technology
  Patna, in Mechanical Engineering,but I got more interest in coding that's why
  I preferred to become a Software Engineer,so I'm soaking up knowledge and
  building the skills necessary to turn my passion into a profession.

<h3>Embracing the Learning Adventure:</h3>
<p>
  I'm embracing the learning curve that comes with coding. Currently, I'm diving
  into language like C++, unraveling the intricacies of algorithms, and delving
  into the foundations of web development. Every challenge I conquer is a step
  closer to my dream of becoming a skilled software engineer.
</p>
<h3>Coding Philosophy:</h3>
<p>
  I believe that coding is an art form that empowers us to craft solutions from
  scratch. My approach centers around curiosity and a growth mindsetâ€”I see each
  line of code as an opportunity to learn, experiment, and create something
  meaningful.
</p>
<h3>Projects and Explorations:</h3>
<p>
  Although I'm in the early stages of my journey, I'm already working on small
  coding projects that fuel my curiosity. From building a basic website like
  Birthday Invitation, each project introduces me to new concepts and pushes me
  to stretch my problem-solving skills.
